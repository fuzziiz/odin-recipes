        <h1>Lumpiang Shanghai</h1>

        <p>Lumpiang Shanghai (also known as Filipino spring rolls, or simply lumpia or lumpiya) is a Filipino deep-fried 
            appetizer consisting of a mixture of giniling (ground pork) with vegetables like carrots, chopped scallions or red onions and garlic, 
            wrapped in a thin egg crÃªpe. Lumpiang Shanghai is regarded as the most basic type of lumpia in Filipino cuisine, and it is usually 
            smaller and thinner than other lumpia variants.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
                <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
                <li>1 carrot, grated</li>
                <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
                <li>2 tbsp salt</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tbsp garlic powder</li>
                <li>2 1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
                <li>1 (16 ounce) package spring roll wrappers</li>
                <li>1/4 cup water, or as needed</li>
                <li>1 1/2 quarts oil for frying</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine ground pork, ground beef, onion, and carrot in a large bowl; mix well with hands. 
                    Gradually blend in soy sauce, salt, garlic powder, and pepper until incorporated.</li>

                <li>Working one at a time, lay a wrapper on a flat surface with a corner pointing at you. 
                    Place about 2 tablespoons filling in a line, no thicker than your thumb, across the center of the wrapper. 
                    Moisten the edges of wrapper with water. Fold the bottom edge of wrapper snugly over filling. 
                    Fold in the left and right sides of wrapper towards the center. Roll up tightly to seal in filling.</li>

                <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or heavy skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                
                <li>Working in batches, fry lumpia in hot oil, turning once, until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. 
                    Cut lumpia in half, or serve as-is with dipping sauce.</li>
            </ol>
